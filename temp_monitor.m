% TEMP_MONITOR 
% This function reads the voltage from the arduino and calculates the
% according temperature. It uses the tic and toc command to plot a graph
% which plots the temperature as it is calculated and updates every second
%
% Whilst the temperature calculated is between 18-24 degrees it displays a
% constant green LED, below 18 the yellow LED flashes every 0.25 seconds,
% above 18 and the red flashes every 0.5 seconds.
